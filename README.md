# ETL Pipeline Demo

This repository holds a demo I put together for a sample Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) pipeline. I'm working with a [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) dataset I found on Kaggle for this one, the [Discogs Database All Release Data](https://www.kaggle.com/sohrabdaemi/discogs-database-all-release-data). Discogs is a crowdsourced database of audio recording information; it also serves as an online marketplace where people can buy/sell audio CDs, vinyls, tape cassettes, etc.
